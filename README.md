Beginning Game Programming for Teens with Python  https://www.raywenderlich.com/24252/beginning-game-programming-for-teens-with-python

This is my first ever made Python game. The code was writing on a rain full Sunday.
And is practice of programming code.

I had a great learning experience in doing this code.
LotÂ´s of thanks to Julian Meyer.

Installations notes:
git clone https://github.com/adamandersen/BunniesandBadgers

Run the game by opening a terminal and type:
python game.py
